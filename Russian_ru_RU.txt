This package contains a few lists of Russian words and an affix file to
be used with a well-known ispell spelling checker.  It may be especially
useful for UNIX users.  However, as the package supports five different
character sets used for Russian, it may be of interest for DOS, OS/2
and Windows users too.

The word lists are based on the list collected about ten years ago by
Neal Dalton.  After removing mistaken words and adding many new rules
and words, the dictionaries contain now over 139,000 basic words and
produce over 1,367,000 related words (compared to 52,000 words in Neal's
version and 952,000 words in the dictionary by K. Knizhnik).

This package seems to be the only one that supports the right spelling
of words with the Russian letter 'yo' (other dictionaries simply
replace the letter 'yo' by 'ye').

Further detailed documentation on the package is in Russian (koi8-r
character set) in README.koi file.

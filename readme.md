## Idea

Since installing a new language requires some non easy procedures. The idea is to collect here the dictionaries ready for use.

Today this contains a list of some languages, the idea is to extends the list with help from the community.

## Adding a new language

My primary language is Spanish, then I'm not sure of the state and quality of the different languages added here.

Please if you found a better dictionary or something to improve, your change will be welcome.

To add a new language:

 * Download the language file from link above.
 * Rename the "some.oxt" file to "some.zip"
 * Unzip the file
 * Look for three files: "lang.aff", "lang.dic" and "readme_lang.txt"(or something similar)
 * Open the "lang.aff" to check the encoding used. Such the line: "SET ISO-8859-1"
 * Convert that file to UTF-8 from the used encoding
 * Convert "lang.dic" to UTF-8 from the used encoding.
 * Convert "readme_lang.txt" to UTF-8 from the used encoding.
 * Change "SET ISO-8859-1" to "SET UTF-8"
 * Copy "readme_lang.txt" to "lang.txt"
 * Copy these three files to this repository
 * Open a pull request to help improve this package! Thank you.

## Iconv and Encodings

[Iconv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv) may be used to convert a file to UTF-8 from another encoding. For example:

    iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 en_CA.aff > en_CA_utf8.aff

You can use the file command to check an encoding:

    file -bi en_CA_utf8.aff

Example output:

    text/plain; charset=utf-8

Note that `us-ascii` might be reported if there are no unicode (utf-8) characters present in the file.
